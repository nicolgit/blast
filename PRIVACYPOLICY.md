# Introduction

Welcome to Blast, an open-source password and secrets keeper developed in Flutter. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our app.

# Information we collect

Since Blast is an open-source project, we do not collect any personal data from users. All data stored within the app is kept locally on your device or in your chosen cloud storage, encrypted with a master password.

# Optional Use of OneDrive

Blast offers the option to use OneDrive for storing your encrypted password file. 
If you choose to use OneDrive, the app will request access to your OneDrive account to save and retrieve the encrypted file. This access is used solely for the purpose of storing and managing your password file and is not used for any other purpose.

# Data Security

We use industry-standard encryption methods to protect your data. All passwords and secrets are stored in an encrypted file using 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). This ensures that your data remains secure and private.

# Third-Party Services

Blast does not use any third-party services that collect data. Your data is never shared with any external entities, except for the optional use of OneDrive as described above.

# User Rights

As a user, you have full control over your data. You can view, edit, and delete your data at any time. Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no need for data access or portability requests.

# Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we will notify users of significant changes through the app.
