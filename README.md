# 💥 Blast 💥
your passwords, safe and sound.

# What is Blast?
Blast is an open-source password and secrets keeper developed in Flutter. It can be used on **Android**, **iOS**, **Windows**, **Web**, **Linux**, and **Mac**. It stores your passwords in an encrypted file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "master password") instead of all the username/password combinations that you use.

There are many password keepers out there, what makes Blast different? 
* Blast doesn't require its own cloud to work. It's designed to use your favorite cloud as a backend or just your local file system. 
* All your data is kept in **one single file** protected by a master password. The file is in an easily extendable .json format. Before being saved, it is encrypted using the 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), making it super easy to move elsewhere.
* Written from the ground up using Flutter, one of the most widely used multiplatform frameworks. One single source code will build versions for all the current most used platforms.
