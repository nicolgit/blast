# Blast Password Manager
## Your Passwords, Safe and Sound

Blast is an open-source password and secrets keeper developed in Flutter. It can be used on Android, iOS, Windows, Web, Linux, and Mac. It stores your passwords in an encrypted file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "master password") instead of all the username/password combinations that you use.

Why choose Blast?

* No Proprietary Cloud Needed: Blast doesn't require its own cloud to work. It's designed to use your favorite cloud as a backend or just your local file system.
* Secure Storage: All your data is kept in one single file protected by a master password. The file is in an easily extendable .json format. Before being saved, it is encrypted using the 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), making it super easy to move elsewhere.
* Cross-Platform Compatibility: Written from the ground up using Flutter, one of the most widely used multiplatform frameworks. One single source code will build versions for all the current most used platforms.
