your passwords safe and sound.

# What is (or would like to be) Blast?
Blast is an open-source password keeper developed in Flutter. It can be used on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and Mac.

While there are many password keepers out there, both commercial and free, I decided to develop my own personal one. Why? Well, for this type of tool, having access to the source code is a huge plus. It allows for open discussions, which can help you understand whether or not you can trust the code.

One of the great things about Blast is that it doesn't require its own cloud. Instead, it's designed to use your favorite cloud as a backend. The plan is to support local device storage, OneDrive, Google, Dropbox, and iDrive. All of your information will be stored in one file, and the format is open-source and available to anyone.

In the future, I may evaluate whether or not a dedicated additional cloud can provide additional benefits. This will be optional and will never be required to use the app.
